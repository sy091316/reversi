      <p class="wix">At first you might think that Professor Patterson was kidding. A little commentary about garlic mentioned here. A little anecdote in passing there. Upon reflection, however, it would become clear that the mentions belied a deep set obsession with the odiforous bulb.
    Making many question whether there was vampire trauma in his past.</p>
      <p class="great-vibes">It was obsession that would eventually lead to his demise.</p>
