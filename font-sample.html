    <h1 class="wix">A Grocery Store Garlic Obsession</h1>
    <p class="wix">At first you might think that Professor Patterson was kidding. A little commentary about garlic mentioned here. A little anecdote in passing there. Upon reflection, however, it would become clear that the mentions belied a deep set obsession with the odiforous bulb.
    Making many question whether there was vampire trauma in his past.</p>
    <p>It was obsession that would eventually lead to his demise.</p>
